## Upgrade Guide v2.2.0

This document provides guidelines for node operators upgrading from Passage `v2.0.1` to `v2.2.0`.

### Option 1: Using Cosmovisor

The following instructions assume the `cosmovisor` binary is already installed and cosmovisor is set up as a systemd service. If this is not the case, please refer to [Using Cosmovisor](https://docs.cosmos.network/main/build/tooling/cosmovisor) for instructions on how to install and set up `cosmovisor`.

Build the upgrade binary `v2.2.0` from source:

```
git clone https://github.com/envadiv/Passage3D
cd Passage3D
git checkout v2.2.0
make build
```

Ensure the `passage` binary has been built:
```
./build/passage version
```
You should see the following:

`v2.2.0`


Create a `v2.2.0` directory and copy the upgrade binary (v2.2.0) to the directory:

```
mkdir -p $HOME/.passage/cosmovisor/upgrades/v2.2.0/bin
cp ~/Passage3D/build/passage $HOME/.passage/cosmovisor/upgrades/v2.2.0/bin
```

Ensure the right `passage` binary has been placed in the directory:
```
$HOME/.passage/cosmovisor/upgrades/v2.2.0/bin/passage version
```


You should see the following:

`v2.2.0`

At the proposed block height, cosmovisor will automatically stop the current binary ``(v2.0.1)``, set the upgrade binary as the current binary ``(v2.2.0)``, and then (depending on the cosmovisor settings) perform a backup and restart the node.

### Option 2: Without Cosmovisor

Using `cosmovisor` to perform the upgrade is not required. Node operators also have the option to manually update the `passage` binary at the time of the upgrade.

When the chain halts at the proposed upgrade height, stop the current process running passage.

**Warning**:- Please execute these steps only after the upgrade height is reached on the network. Building and restarting the process before the upgrade height might cause data corruption in the node database.  

Build the upgrade binary ``(v2.2.0)`` from source:

```
git clone https://github.com/envadiv/Passage3D
cd Passage3D
git checkout v2.2.0
make install
```


Ensure the passage binary has been updated:

`passage version`

You should see the following:

`v2.2.0`

Restart the process running `passage`.
